# Pasifika-OS
Pasifika OS is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Lubuntu which is a faster, more lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. Pasifika OS will strive to meet the operating system requirements of the Pacific Islands region and will focus on ease of use, ease of resources, modern, elegant, comfortable yet powerful.

Please do take note that since we currently do not have enough contributors to Pasifika OS, we will only NOT fork Lubuntu for the time being since we do not have enough hands to maintain our own source code, but will maintain the benefit of the collaboration that takes place in the upstream community.
